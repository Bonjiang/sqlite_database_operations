### Datasets Selected

I selected two transparent pricing datasets from two different hospital systems: Stony Brook University Hospital and Catholic Health St. Joseph Hospital. I found these datasets under the HHA 504 Week 3 folder. Thes datasets provided a lot fo info with various categorical and numerical columns. The first set of Stony Brook had a lot of info regarding deidentified rates, cash prices, gross charges, and different types of insurances. The second set of Catholic Health had a lot of inforegarding charges, prices, and packages.
