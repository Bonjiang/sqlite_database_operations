### Datasets Selected

I selected two transparent pricing datasets from two different hospital systems: Stony Brook University Hospital and Catholic Health St. Joseph Hospital. I found these datasets under the HHA 504 Week 3 folder. Thes datasets provided a lot fo info with various categorical and numerical columns. The first set of Stony Brook had a lot of info regarding deidentified rates, cash prices, gross charges, and different types of insurances. The second set of Catholic Health had a lot of inforegarding charges, prices, and packages.

### Exploratory Data Analysis Process

I conducted the same process for both datasets. First, I wanted a data overview of the first few rows of each column. From this, I saw many NaN outputs so I wanted to check for the sum of the missing values of each column in the individual dataset. There were a lot. Then, I checked for frequency counts for categorical columns, which varied between the datasets. Next, I wanted to see the data distribution using histograms and boxplots. The histograms showed skewness of the data and the boxplots showed outliers. Loops were used for both because there were a lot of numerical columns. Finally I generated summary statistics for both datasets.
